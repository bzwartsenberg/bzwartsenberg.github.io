I am a postdoc working in the [UBC computer science department][ubccs] with [Frank Wood][fwood], and in the [UBC statistics department][ubcstat] with [Trevor Campbell][trevor]. I work on applying techniques of probabilistic programming for inverting physical models, with robust statistical guarantees. I am part of the [DSI-CRN][dsicrn] collaboration, which aims to leverage machine learning methods to develop better composite materials.

Before starting as a machine learning researcher, I did a PhD in condensed matter physics at UBC in the group of [Andrea Damascelli][andrea]. My research focussed on understanding the [interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions][paper]. Before that, was a MSc student in Amsterdam, working with [Mark Golden][mark], understanding [the effects of light on the energy states of topological insulators][spv].
